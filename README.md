## Bondy is a WAMP router designed for availability and scalability

Bondy is a high-performance, distributed [WAMP](using/wamp-concepts.md) router. It scales horizontally and vertically to support a high number of concurrent clients while maintaining low latency and fault tolerance. 

Bondy is the reliable application message router, providing both Routed Remote Procedure Call \(RPC\) and Publish & Subscribe communication patterns. It is ideally suited for microservices architectures and IoT applications.
