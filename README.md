# Welcome

{% hint style="success" %}
### Bondy is an open source, distributed, scalable networking platform for microservices and Internet Of Things applications written in Erlang. It implements the open Web Application Messaging Protocol \(WAMP\) offering both Publish & Subscribe and routed Remote Procedure Calls.

Bondy was **designed for availability and scalability**. It scales horizontally and vertically to support a high number of concurrent clients while maintaining low latency and fault tolerance. 

Bondy provides a **reliable application message router**, offering both routed Remote Procedure Call \(RPC\) and Publish & Subscribe communication patterns. By combining these two patterns into a single infrastructure component, Bondy can be used for the entire messaging requirements of a distributed system, thus **reducing technology stack complexity, as well as networking overheads**.

## **What is WAMP?**

WAMP \(Web Application Messaging Protocol\) is an open standard WebSocket and TCP/IP protocol that provides two application messaging patterns in one unified protocol: 

* routed **Remote Procedure Calls** and
* **Publish & Subscribe**

The WAMP protocol is a community effort and the [specification](https://wamp-proto.org) is made available for free under an open license for everyone to use or implement.
