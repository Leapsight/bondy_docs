## What is Bondy?

#### Bondy is a high-performance, distributed WAMP router **designed for availability and scalability**. It scales horizontally and vertically to support a high number of concurrent clients while maintaining low latency and fault tolerance. 

Bondy is a reliable application message router, providing both routed Remote Procedure Call \(RPC\) and Publish & Subscribe communication patterns. It is ideally suited for microservices architectures and IoT applications.

## **What is WAMP?**

WAMP \(Web Application Messaging Protocol\) is an open standard WebSocket and TCP/IP protocol that provides two application messaging patterns in one unified protocol: 

* routed **Remote Procedure Calls** and
* **Publish & Subscribe**

The WAMP protocol is a community effort and the [specification](https://wamp-proto.org) is made available for free under an open license for everyone to use or implement.
