## Source Code Layout

### Maintain existing style

{% tabs %} {% tab title="Rule" %}
When editing a module written by someone else, stick to the style in which it was written. If a project has an overall style, stick to that when writing new modules as well.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Rationale" %}
It's better to keep a module that just looks ugly to you than to have a module that looks half ugly to you, half ugly to somebody else.
{% tab title="Examples" %}
{% endtab %} {% endtabs %}
